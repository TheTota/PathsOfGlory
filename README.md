### The elevator Pitch
Chunks is a mobile action game that was initially created during the Global Game Jam, of which the theme was "Repair". The game is about identifying and fixing problems at an increased pace to try beating your previous high score. Concretely, the player browses through a cube made of 6 unique faces that each have their own ecosystem and events that will have to be fixed, in order to keep the cube alive for as long as possible.
