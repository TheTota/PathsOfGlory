  preBattleFirstTimeLine: <b>Nice to meet you commander.</b>\n\nLet me introduce
    myself, Lee Detmold, young graduate of the Imperial Academy of Economic Sciences.\n\nI
    passed the final exams with the highest score ever recorded. But enough bragging,
    let's battle!
  preBattleWonLastLines:
  - <b>Back to give it another try?</b>\n\nLet's get to it without further delay,
    I have a meeting with the treasurers of the Empire scheduled right after this
    battle.
  preBattleLostLastLines:
  - <b>Revenge in sight!</b>\n\nHonestly, I'm not used to failure.\nTo tell the truth,
    I can't stand it. I have to win today!
  postBattleWinLines:
  - <b>It was a close call.</b>\n\nYou have a very interesting style, but it wasn't
    decisive this time.
  postBattleLossLines:
  - <b>You excel in your field.</b>\n\nI am really impressed. You can read your opponent
    and adapt in an exceptional way.\n\nYou have certainly earned your position in
    the League, congratulations.
  postUnitsFightLossLines:
  - I must have made a miscalculation...\n\nHow uncharacteristic, I'm never wrong.
  - Every strategy involves a share of risk.\n\nWell, in my case, I'm paying the
    price right now.
  - Well done commander.\n\nI wonder if you have managed to read my mind...\n\nWith
    all that is said about you, it could be possible...
  - Interesting.\n\nYou make a very particular use of your resources...
  postUnitsFightWinLines:
  - Exactly what I expected.\n\nLike everything else, the key is in numbers and probabilities.
  - A masterstroke!\n\nThis is even giving me the shivers!
  - 'The reward outweighs the risk.\n\nThus, I win this round. '
  - A perfect calculation, an obvious result.\n\nFrom now on, I guess you have realized
    your opponent's talent.
  postUnitsFightDrawLines:
  - No... I must have been careless.\n\nImpossible, my focus is unparalleled in the
    Empire.
  - An anomaly in the figures...\n\nI'm confused, but it doesn't matter.
