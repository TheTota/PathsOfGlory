  preBattleFirstTimeLine: <b>Another challenger...</b>\n\nCongratulations for making
    it this far in the League, but I'm afraid that your rise is about to end now.\n\nFrom
    here, there's no more clowning. Prepare for battle.
  preBattleWonLastLines:
  - <b>I warned you, commander.</b>\n\nBut I can see taht you still want some more.
    After all, such determination is... admirable.
  preBattleLostLastLines:
  - <b>It's time to make things right</b>\n\nYou have defeated me thanks to some
    kind of miracle.\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to prove it was pure
    luck.
  postBattleWinLines:
  - <b>No surprises.</b>\n\nI understand your ambition but it seems that your intellect
    has shown its limits.\n\nFarewell, commander.
  postBattleLossLines:
  - <b>What a miracle.</b>\n\nI don't really know what just happened, but it can
    only be a storke of luck.\n\nI can't see any other explanation...
  postUnitsFightLossLines:
  - I had not imagined this outcome.\n\nI won't let myself be troubled, I know perfectly
    what I'm doing.
  - What a mistake on my part.\n\nPerhaps I've mistaken a type of soldier for another
    on the units recap.
  - Luck seems to be on your side.\n\nBut, you know, luck turns, so don't count on
    it too much.
  - Everything seemed clear to me from my previous move.\n\nHow could I fail this
    time?
  postUnitsFightWinLines:
  - This will tip the balance of the battle in my favour.\n\nI suggest that you focus,
    commander, if you want to have a chance here.
  - I knew it.\n\nMy strategy is really flawless!
  - It is only with a complete strategic mastery of all the elements involved in
    a battle that one becomes one of the best.
  - I would have thought that the League's rising star would put up more resistance.\n\nWhat
    a disappointment...
  postUnitsFightDrawLines:
  - You may be satisfied with this kind of result, but I'm not.
  - It's a pretty disappointing outcome.\n\nThis isn't getting us anywhere.
