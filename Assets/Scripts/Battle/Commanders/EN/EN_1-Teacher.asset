  preBattleFirstTimeLine: <b>Welcome on the battlefield!</b>\n\nI was waiting for
    you commander!\nWe will compete according to the rules of the League.\n\nI will
    explain them throughout the battle, so let's get started.
  preBattleWonLastLines:
  - Good to see you again, Commander.\nIf you want to be successful in this League,
    you will have to persevere.\n\nLet the battle begin!
  preBattleLostLastLines:
  - Commander, you have already defeated me.\nYou should face the higher-ranked opponents
    in the League, unless you've already done so.\n\nAnyway, let's get started.
  postBattleWinLines:
  - Fear nothing of this defeat commander, the rules of the League are new to you.\n\nCome
    and face me again, but this time focus on my strategy rather than my instructions.
  postBattleLossLines:
  - <b>Congratulations for your victory!</b>\n\nYou are really a part of the League
    now, 9 more opponents are waiting for you.\n\nBy the way, the next one is my
    son, good luck commander!
  postUnitsFightLossLines:
  - <b>You have just played one round of the battle.</b>\n\nEach battle consists
    of 15 rounds like these.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, you choose a unit
    to send to the battlefield.
  - <b>Each commander has 5 types of units, with a stock of 3 each.</b>\n\nEach type
    of unit counters and is countered by other types of units.\nRefer to the units
    recap panel.
  - <b>Winning a round impacts the balance of the battle.</b>\n\nThe first 3 rounds
    have no impact.\nAs the battle goes on, the impact of the rounds will grow.
  - <b>At the end of the last round, the commander who dominates the balance wins
    the battle.</b>\n\nNote that each commander fights on equal terms.
  - <b>Within the League, each commander is unique.</b>\n\nEach of your competitors
    will use its own strategy.\nObviously, the best commanders in the League use
    the best strategies.
  - <b>The key to defeating your opponent is to identify his strategy.</b>\n\nYou
    will not rise to the top until you have developed a methodology for analyzing
    your opponent.
  - <b>Your opponent's strategy is about how he uses his units..</b>\n\nSometimes
    you will have to face the same opponent several times in order to understand
    him.
  - <b>You have several tools at your disposal to identify your opponent's strategy.</b>\n\nI'm
    using my own strategy right now and in each of my battles.
  - '<b>First tool: round history.</b>\n\nDuring a battle, you have a constantly
    updated history of the previous rounds at your disposal.'
  - '<b>Second tool: talks.</b>\n\nThe League commanders are quite talkative and
    will speak to you between rounds.\nSometimes their messages will contain important
    information about their strategy.'
  - '<b>Third tool: the battle recap.</b>\n\nAt the end of a battle, you will always
    receive a recap.\nWhen in doubt about the strategy of an opponent who has defeated
    you, dwell on it for a while.'
  - <b>In summary,</b> each commander has a stock of units to spend for 15 rounds.\n\nEach
    commander will use his own strategy to defeat you, which it will often be essential
    to identify with the tools at your disposal.
  - <b>From now on, you know everything commander.</b>\n\nWith experience and a few
    battles, I'm sure you'll be ready to challenge any opponent!
  - The training is over, but you must defeat me to advance.\n\nOld Warfield is still
    in the League after all!
