  preBattleFirstTimeLine: <b>WELCOME IN THE ARENA.</b>\n\nToday, I will PAINT THE
    BATTLEFIELD WITH THE BLOOD OF YOUR SOLDIERS!\n\nWell not really because of the
    protection spells applied by the League's mages... BUT YOU GET THE IDEA!
  preBattleWonLastLines:
  - <b>You seem to love a good SLAUGHTER!</b>\n\nPrepare your units to DIE!\n<size=70%>actually
    not...</size>\nTO FALL ONCE MORE!

    on you.

    and take your revenge, if you're foolish enough. I'm waiting for you!
  postBattleLossLines:
  - <b>I AM DONE!</b>\n\nThis League was my whole LIFE. I have no more reasons to
    EXIST IN THIS WORLD...\n\n<size=60%>In fact, I forgot that I am still part of
    the League, sorry I got carried away again. Congratulations Commander, it was
    a great battle. Good luck in the future, don't forget me.</size>
  postUnitsFightLossLines:
  - NOOOOOOOOOO!\nNO, NO, NO.\nNOOOOOOOOOOO!\n\nOr.... YES?

    expecting a different result!
  - I lost...\n\nWHAT? I LOST... NOOOO! I'M A FAILURE, A TOTAL MESS...\n\n<size=50%>Oh.
    The battle isn't over, I might have got confused with the rounds... whoops.</size>
  - USELESS WARRIORS!\n\nThey're such SOFT COWARDS, barely able to keep their WEAPON
    IN HAND... I'm getting carried away.
  postUnitsFightWinLines:
  - WHAT A FATAL BLOW!\n\nThe control of the battle eludes you, you're SHAKING, CRYING
    because of this humiliation!\nWell, at least that's how I would react if I were
    you.
  - YES, YES! IT'S PERFECT!\n\nAin't nothing changing when it's all WORKING!
  - I LOVE THESE WARRIORS!\n\nRipping out the HEART of their ENEMIES to put it in
    their... I'm getting carried away.
  - WHAT A SLAUGHTER!\n\nI want it AGAIN, and AGAIN!
  postUnitsFightDrawLines:
  - THE SIMULTANEOUS CLASHING OF WEAPONS!\n\nWhat a rush, I'll never get tired of
    it.
  - NO, NO, NO !\n\nThis won't do it, I have to make some changes RIGHT AWAY!
