  preBattleFirstTimeLine: <b>Greetings, Commander.</b>\n\nI am Mordred Warfield,
    son of Arthur Warfield and the youngest commander of the League.\n\nYour presence
    indicates that you have defeated my father, but the old man is a thing of the
    past. Onward!
  preBattleWonLastLines:
  - <b>Greetings, Commander.</b>\n\nThe outcome of our last battle was favorable
    to me, but I still need to improve.\n\nGive me your best performance commander!
  preBattleLostLastLines:
  - <b>Greetings, Commander.</b>\n\nThank you for giving me another chance to prove
    myself.\n\nThe battle promises to be interesting!
  postBattleWinLines:
  - <b>What a victory!</b>\n\nMy father will be really pleased to hear that I have
    defeated you.\n\nCome on, let's do it again commander, I feel ready for another
    battle!
  postBattleLossLines:
  - <b>Well done, Commander!</b>\n\nI'm disappointed with the loss, but I still have
    a lot to learn.\n\nYou excelled today, and it was a memorable lesson. Good luck
    for your future battles!
  postUnitsFightLossLines:
  - What a pity, I was so sure of my move.\n\nAt last I was not careful, well done.
  - It can only be luck!\n\nUnless you've got me figured out... Forgive my impulsiveness,
    Commander.
  - Commander, you got me.\n\nNothing to say on this one, but don't let your guard
    down!
  - Maybe I should have stuck to the strategy my Father taught me instead of reversing
    it...\n\nIt's too late now.
  postUnitsFightWinLines:
  - Father taught me well.\n\nHowever, I was able to adjust his teachings to ensure
    these results.
  - Excellent!\n\nI'm already preparing the next round, get ready commander, it's
    going to make some noise!
  - I'm on the right track, I can feel it.\n\nI am confident in my strategy and planning
    for this battle.
  - What a masterstroke!\n\nIt's that kind of small victory that will bring me closer
    to the Grand Champion title one day, Commander.
  postUnitsFightDrawLines:
  - An understandable result.\n\nAfter all, we are fighting on an equal footing and
    the League is very strict about this.
  - What a boring result.\n\nCome on, let's be more creative than that!
  - I would tell you a joke to distract you from this result, but we have to stay
    focused.
