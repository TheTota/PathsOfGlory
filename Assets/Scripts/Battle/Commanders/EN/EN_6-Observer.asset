    meet you, your recent victories are starting to make some noise within the Empire.\n\nI
    am not a commander by profession, but rather by passion. Let's battle!

    more vigilant.

  postUnitsFightWinLines:
  - The League offers me such a distraction from my routine at the Academy.\n\nMoreover,
    it allows me to use my knowledge in the service of the Empire.
  - I always try to stay one step ahead of my opponent.\n\nIt served me well this
    time.

    but we'll see.
  - What a joy to see my units victorious on the battlefield.\n\nI will never get
    tired of it!
  postUnitsFightDrawLines:
  - How fascinating!\n\nTow units from two different armies, with the same amount
    of troops and the same equipment, giving a perfect equality.
  - The Imperial Academy trains the best soldiers, mages and commanders of the Empire.\n\nIf
    you make further progress in the League, you will meet one of its prodigy students.\nA
    really, really talented individual.
