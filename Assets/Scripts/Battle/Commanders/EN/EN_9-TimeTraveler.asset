  preBattleFirstTimeLine: <b>Welcome commander!</b>\n\nMarco Poulet, former renowned
    explorer and now one of the finest strategists of the Empire.\n\nEverybody's
    talking about you now, "a potential new Great Champion". Let's see if you have
    the potential.
  preBattleWonLastLines:
  - <b>Be up to the challenge this time.</b>\n\nI sense your immense potential, commander.
    Give it all you have today, you are approaching the end of an illustrious path
    to glory.
  preBattleLostLastLines:
  - <b>Good to see you again.</b>\n\nI have survived many things, but I don't know
    if I will survive losing to you once more!\n\nCome on, let's get started!
  postBattleWinLines:
  - <b>You're almost there, but not yet.</b>\n\nIf you want to conquer this League,
    you will have to step up your game.\n\nPersevere and you will become one of the
    greatest!
  postBattleLossLines:
  - <b>You are worthy of your reputation.</b>\n\nHowever, I am not sure that this
    is enough to defeat your next opponent.\n\nThe whole Empire will attend your
    next battle, may luck be on your side.
  postUnitsFightLossLines:
  - I have already lost myself in a jungle, a forest, a labyrinth and the guest room
    of the imperial palace... \nBut never during the course of a battle!
  - No matter how hard I tried to anticipate your move, it didn't work this time...
    But I'm convinced it will work next time! Yes yes yes!
  - My strategy is failing me.\n\nYet two rounds ago you... I'm talking too much.\nBy
    the way, I think all the commanders in this League are too chatty, aren't they?
  - This defeat gives me flashbacks of the time I challenged the Great Champion...
    \n\nI'm not sure I've fully recovered from it.
  postUnitsFightWinLines:
  - 'This victory reminds me that I could have become a commander, but my dream has
    always been to go beyond the confines of the known world. '
  - Being only one move ahead of your opponent is not enough! \n\nI learned this
    at my own expense in an expedition that... I would rather not talk about.
  - With all the people I've been able to meet, I have a certainty.\nYour past actions
    define your present actions, even in battle!
  - Since I retired, the League has kept me busy.\n\nI have defeated every opponent
    on my way, but I have never defeated the Great Champion. He truly is on another
    level.
  postUnitsFightDrawLines:
  - It reminds me of a confrontation with natives far beyond the borders of the Empire,
    a long time ago.\n\nA fight with my bare hands, me against their chief according
    to their customs. We both ended up on the floor!
  - Sometimes the rules of the League make me think of a more complex version of
    the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors...\n\nThink about it for a moment.
