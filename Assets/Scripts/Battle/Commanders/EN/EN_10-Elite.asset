  preBattleFirstTimeLine: <b>Your path to glory has led you to me.</b>\n\nI have
    observed your rise in the League. Right from your first victories, I felt something
    in you.\n\nThat something led you to me today. Fate will decide the outcome of
    this battle, and the greatest commander will emerge victorious.
  preBattleWonLastLines:
  - <b>Once again, fate puts you on my path..</b>\n\nJust like last time, I will
    be ready to defend my title.\n\nMark my words, you will never defeat me. You're
    not the first to try.
  preBattleLostLastLines:
  - <b>Let me show you who the real champion is.</b>\n\nAlthough the succession of
    title cannot take place until a year has passed since his change of ownership,
    I persist in demonstrating to you my superiority on the battlefield.
  postBattleWinLines:
  - <b>Years without any defeat.</b>\n\nAnd it continues today. Such is the will
    of destiny.\n\nForever, I will remain the number one in the Empire, the greatest
    commander of all time.
  postBattleLossLines:
  - <b>Thus, fate has chosen you.</b>\n\nYou now hold the most illustrious title
    that any commander can hold.\n\nHowever, this defeat does not change anything
    for me. I will always consider myself the greatest commander of all time, the
    Great Champion... Farewell.
  postUnitsFightLossLines:
  - A loss for me and a win for you.\n\nBoth are fleeting. In the end, the balance
    is always restored.
  - An interesting move, but I can adapt to any situation.\n\nWhen I lose, I retaliate.
    When I win, I strengthen my advantage.
  - You are a great commander, indeed. But you will never be the greatest the Empire
    has ever known.
  - Briefly surpassed but quickly back on my feet and already ready to answer.
  - There is no doubt about your mastery, but you are not a veteran like me.\n\nYou
    don't have the perspective that I have on every move and every outcome of a confrontation.
  postUnitsFightWinLines:
  - Since the day I joined the League, I have never been defeated.\n\nNot once has
    an opponent managed to beat me. That's not going to change today.
  - My title is well deserved.\nThe day when someone comes to steal it from me has
    certainly not arrived.
  - Don't expect me to reveal the slightest clue about my strategy.\n\nI will never
    betray myself.
  - The Grand Champion has the complete confidence of the Emperor.\n\nI will never
    part with this privilege.
  - You are not good enough.\n\nYour success has gone to your head, nobody beats
    me.
  postUnitsFightDrawLines:
  - Close call.\n\nHow many times are you going to escape destiny?
  - I wonder if it is the will of fate, or luck.\n\nWhat is the difference between
    both?
